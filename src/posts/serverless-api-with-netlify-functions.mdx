Over the last few years, serverless applications have been growing in
popularity. There are many use cases in which a serverless solution is more
practical and more convenient than the traditional server solution. In this
post, we'll look at setting up a serverless Express.js API using Netlify
functions.

### Overview

Before we dive into the code for this demo application, let's talk about a few
concepts at a high-level.

### Serverless

'Serverless' is a term that is used for what can generally be thought of as a
method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. Rather than setting up
specific infrastructure, or a server, to provide the backend services, you can
utilize a "serverless" provider to handle this functionality instead. This was
first popularized by AWS Lambda but is now a service offered by many other
companies as well, including the one we'll be looking at today, Netlify.

### AWS Lambda

As mentioned above, AWS Lambda is the most popular provider of serverless
computing. Here's how AWS Lamba describes itself in its own words:

> AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay
> only for the compute time you consume.

> With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend
> service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes
> care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.
> You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or
> call it directly from any web or mobile app.

As great as this sounds (and it really is great), setting up an AWS lambda
function can be a tedious process, requiring quite a bit of configuration that
can be easily confusing to someone is who new to serverless functions. If you're
curious to see for yourself, here's an
[example tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-eclipse/v1/user-guide/lambda-tutorial.html)
directly from the AWS docs. But not to worry, that's why we're here to talk
about Netlify Functions.

### Netlify Functions

Netlify Functions greatly simplifies the process for running serverless
functions. Using Netlify Functions, we can simply write our lambda function and
drop it into the functions folder of our Netlify-hosted application. Behind the
scenes, Netlify handles the interaction with AWS for us. We don't even need an
AWS account. Every Netlify account is set up for this feature out of the box.
There's no setup, servers, or ops required.

Let's see what this looks like in code.

### Our application

The code for this demo can be found
[here](https://github.com/adamgoth/netlify-serverless-demo). For the purposes of
this post, I will assume the reader has some basic familiarity with
[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and Node as we will be using these to build
our API.

If we take a look at our package dependencies, we have just five packages:

`nodemon` is used to automatically restart our server while we're working on it
in development

`express` gives us our API framework

`body-parser` is middleware that allows us the parse our request bodies

`serverless-http` allows us to wrap our API for serverless use

`netlify-lambda` is a tool that helps us build our application code so that it
can be consumed correctly by Netlify using Netlify Functions

The other thing to note in the `package.json` file are the two scripts. We have
`"start": "nodemon server-local.js"` which is used for development, and
`"build": "netlify-lambda build express"` which is used to build and deploy.

The `start` script is fairly straight forward, it will just execute our
`server-local.js` file which in turn is calling `express/server.js`. This works
for local development, but we need to do additional work in our `build` script
for the application to work as a serverless function once deployed to Netlify.
In the `build` script, we call
[`netlify-lambda build`](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda#netlify-lambda-build)
which takes a source folder as an argument (`express` in our case) and outputs
it to a built folder. The built folder is where Netlify will look for our
serverless functions. We have a couple of options for how we specify this. We
could specify the designated folder within Netlify's application settings using
Netlify's web app, or within our application code, we can specify the designated
folder with a `netlify.toml` configuration file. In our case, we'll use a
configuration file that lives in our root directory that looks like this:

```
// netlify.toml

[build]
  command = "npm install && npm run build"
  functions = "functions"
```

With our scripts and build configuration accounted for, let's take a look at the
core of the application.

The core of the application lives in the `express/server.js` file, and in our
case, is just 29 lines.

```javascript
"use strict"
const express = require("express")
const serverless = require("serverless-http")
const app = express()
const bodyParser = require("body-parser")
const router = express.Router()

app.use(bodyParser.json())
app.use("/.netlify/functions/server", router) // path must route to lambda
app.use("/", router)

router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" })
  res.write("<h1>Up and running</h1>")
  res.end()
})

router.post("/doSomething", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // maybe do some database interaction or third-party API call here!
    res.status(200).send({ data: "success" })
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
    res.status(400).send({ error: "bad request" })
  }
})

module.exports = app
module.exports.handler = serverless(app)
```

If you've ever worked with Express.js, this should look pretty familiar to you.
We have two endpoints, one `GET` endpoint at `/` and one `POST` endpoint at
`/doSomething`.

These endpoints don't do much, but you could do just about anything you would
normally do with `GET` or `POST` endpoints here. Hit a third-party API, connect
to a database, fire off some sort of transaction, etc.

The two lines in the application that are specific to using Netlify's serverless
functions are line 9 and line 29.

As we specified in our `netlify.toml` configuration file, our function code is
going to live at `./netlify/functions/server`. So we will tell our express app
on line 9 to use our `router` object anytime a request is sent to this server.

```
app.use("/.netlify/functions/server", router)
```

Lastly, on line 29, we will utilize the
[`serverless-http`](https://github.com/dougmoscrop/serverless-http) package to
wrap our application up for serverless use. This means our application can work
as expected without any HTTP server, ports, or sockets.

```
module.exports.handler = serverless(app)
```

With that, the application is all set to
[deploy to Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/overview/#deploy-summary).
If you've never deployed on Netlify before, you'll be amazed at how simple it
is. This post won't go into details but it isn't much more than authenticating
your GitHub account and selecting the repo and branch to deploy. Once the
application is deployed, you can start accessing the endpoints we created at
`<your site URL>/.netlify/functions/server`.

### Wrapping up

Hopefully you were able to follow along in creating this Netlify serverless
function. Serverless computing is still a developing and evolving technology but
its popularity continues to grow as more developers find it more suitable to
their needs than traditional server applications.

The particular use case that led me to using Netlify functions is that I needed
to make a third-party API call from my client application that required a
private API key in the header. With just client-side code, there is no good way
to keep your private API key private. I decided I needed a server to proxy the
request through, but I didn't want to create and dedicate an entire server just
to pass one small API request through. So this ended up being a perfect
solution. Now that I know how convenient and simple this can be, I will be
looking for more opportunities to utilize Netlify Functions.

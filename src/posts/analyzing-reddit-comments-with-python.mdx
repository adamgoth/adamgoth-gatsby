In this post, we'll take a look at how to build a simple Python script for word
analysis. We will then apply it to the comment section of any given reddit post.

### Overview

Between my job and side projects, I typically spend most of my time building web
applications using React and Node. That means writing almost exclusively
JavaScript. To keep my perspective on programming fresh and not strictly
confined to a single language, I wanted to take a little time to step out of the
world of JavaScript and explore the world of another programming language. I
decided to come up with a little project idea and to build it with Python.
Python is a powerful yet friendly programming language that is popular with
beginners and experienced programmers alike. It was created in 1991 by Guido van
Rossum, but continues to rise in popularity almost 30 years later. In 2020,
Python was at or near the top of the list for in-demand languages for
programming jobs. It was also deemed by Wired magazine to be
[more popular than ever before](https://www.wired.com/story/python-language-more-popular-than-ever/).
After spending just a short time writing code with Python, it's not hard to see
why it's a popular choice. Let's jump in.

### Setting up

This post will assume you have basic programming knowledge and that you have
Python 3 installed. For more detailed information on installing Python,
[start here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download). The repo for
this project can be found
[here](https://github.com/adamgoth/reddit-comment-analysis). You will notice a
`.py` file containing the full script, as well as a `.ipynb` file containing a
Jupyter Notebook for the script. [The Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is
an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents
that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text, which can
make it easier to follow along and learn how a python script works.

### The script

The script in its entirety can be found
[here](https://github.com/adamgoth/reddit-comment-analysis/blob/master/reddit-comment-analysis.py).

The first thing we need to do is import the requests library. This is what we
will use to make the HTTP request to reddit to get the comment data from the
reddit post. After that, we will initialize a few global variables. We will use
these global variables to keep track of data as we parse through comments.
`comment_count` is an integer and will track the number of comments we parse,
`comment_array` is an array and will hold the actual comment strings, and
`more_comment_ids` is another array that will hold ID strings that we will need
in order to fetch additional comments that are not returned in the initial
payload (commonly found in posts with many comments).

```
# imports
import requests  # The requests library for HTTP requests in Python

# globals
comment_count = 0
comment_array = []
more_comment_ids = []
```

Next, we need to fetch the data for the reddit post. To do that, we can append
`.json` to the end of any reddit post URL.

An example would be:
`https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/krolrb/multicomments.json`.

What we get back is JSON that will have a basic format that looks like this:

```
{
    "kind": "Listing",
    "data": {
        "children": [
            "kind": "t1",
            "data": {
                "body": "",
                "replies": ""
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

A reddit post is referred to as a
"[Listing](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/#listings)". Listings can contain many
kinds of children. A child with a `kind` of `t1` indicates that the child
represents a comment. Within the comments `data` property, among many other
properties, the text of the comment can be found on the `body` property, along
with any possible replies which are located on the `replies` property. Replies
are structured the same way as comments. They contain children and the children
has `kind` and `data` properties. Within every reply to a comment, we may see
another reply to that reply comment. Each of these contains their own
identically formatted children. So in order to analyze all comments within a
thread, we'll have to recursively sift through all comments and replies.

If having to follow each individual comment tree recursively to its end wasn't
tricky enough, there's another issue we have to worry about. Since comment
threads can become quite long, not every comment is always displayed on the
initial thread load. When this happens, reddit shows "load more replies" buttons
within threads. So how do we get these as well? To handle these instances, the
API will deliver a child with a `kind` property value of `more`.

```
{
    "kind": "more",
    "data": {
        "count": 2,
        "name": "t1_ghp1m6v",
        "id": "ghp1m6v",
        "parent_id": "t1_ghozojl",
        "depth": 2,
        "children": [
            "ghp1m6v"
        ]
    }
}
```

The array of `children` within the `more` object will contain a list of thread
IDs that can be used to fetch additional comments. In the code example above,
there is just one child ID, `ghp1m6v`. So in addition to parsing all comment
trees recursively, we will also have to collect any additional comment thread
IDs and then do the same thing for those.

Hopefully, you are still with me at this point. Talking about all of this
without writing any code can be confusing, so let's try to break it down with
some functions that will help us achieve this goal.

The first function we'll write is `parse_children_for_comments`.

```
def parse_children_for_comments(children):
    global comment_count
    global comment_array
    for child in children:
        if child['kind'] == "more":
            children = child['data']['children']
            for id in children:
                more_comment_ids.append(id)
        if child['kind'] == "t1":
            comment_count += 1
            comment_array.append(child['data']['body'])
            get_replies(child['data'])
```

It will take an array of `children` objects that are sent back in the response
data and will pull out the comment text which is found in the `body` property.
For each child in the array argument of `children`, we will check its `kind`. If
the `kind` is `more`, we will loop through and add each id to the global array
we created, `more_comment_ids`. We will eventually come back to this array of
ids and parse through it.

Next, if the `kind` is `t1`, that means we have a comment and we want to read
its text. In order to do that, we simply get the text with
`child['data']['body']` and append it to our global `comment_array` variable.

After appending the comment to the `comment_array`, we need to check if there
are any replies to that comment. Since we will be doing this check many times,
it's best that we write a helper function for it. We'll call it `get_replies`:

```
def get_replies(comment):
    global comment_count
    if comment['replies'] != "":
        children = comment['replies']['data']['children']
        parse_children_for_comments(children)
```

First, we check if there are any replies. When there are no replies, the
`replies` property will be an empty string. If the string is not empty, we know
we have a reply. As I mentioned above, replies take the same format as the
original comment it is replying to. So in order to parse the reply text, we can
reuse the same `parse_children_for_comments` function we already wrote. Since
`parse_children_for_comments` will again call `get_replies`, and `get_replies`
will again call `parse_children_for_comments` until there are no comments left,
this will recursively continue until we reach a child comment with an empty
`replies` property. Pretty neat.

With those helper functions defined, we're ready to fetch our data. In order to
do this, we will use a built-in Python function called
[`input`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input) which will
allow the user to enter a URL to a reddit post.

```
# get url from user
print('enter the reddit post url (e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/krolrb/multicomments/):')
thread_url = input()
```

We can expect the user to paste in a URL for a reddit post. For example, it may
look something like this:
`https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/krolrb/multicomments/`

To get the post data, we need to turn
`https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/krolrb/multicomments/` into
`https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/krolrb/multicomments.json`.

To do that, we can write a small helper function.

```
def sanitize_input(url):
    last_char = url[-1]
    if last_char == '/':
        url = url[:-1]
    url = f'{url}.json'
    return url
```

We pass the URL as an argument into the function. The function checks if the
last character of `url` is a `/` and removes it if it is. Then the function
appends `.json` to the end of `url`. After we pass the user's inputted URL to
this function, we're ready to fetch the post data.

```
# pass user's url to sanitize helper
sanitized_thread_url = sanitize_input(thread_url)

# make network call
req_data = requests.get(sanitized_thread_url, headers={'User-agent': 'adamgoth.com'})

if req_data.status_code != 200:
    print('request failed')
    print(req_data.json())

if req_data.status_code == 200:
    json_data = req_data.json()
    for item in json_data:
        children = item['data']['children']
        parse_children_for_comments(children)
```

We call `requests.get()`, passing our URL as the first parameter, as well as a
headers value for a second parameter. The reason we need to specify a
`User-agent` property in the header is so that we have a unique identity to
reddit. This will ensure we appear entirely anonymous and run into
[rate-limiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting) issues.

Once we have our data back in our `req_data` variable, the first thing we'll
check is if we did not get a `200` response for any reason. If the response is
not `200`, we will print out the error.

Assuming we get a `200`, we can then start parsing the data. We can use the
requests library built-in JSON decoder and called `.json()` on the response. We
then write a simple `for` statement that takes each child in the response data
and passes it to the `parse_children_for_comments` we previously discussed.

After the `for` loop from line 13 completes, we should have a number of comments
stored in our global `comment_array`. Additionally, depending on the number of
comments from the post, we may have found some additional comment IDs and stored
them in our global `more_comment_ids` array. As a reminder, these are IDs we can
use to fetch more comments that did not appear in the initial load. In the
reddit UI, these represent the links within comment threads that appear as "load
more replies", and in our data response, these IDs come from the children that
have a `kind` property value of `more`.

The URL for fetching the additional comment data looks similar to the URL we
used for fetching the initial post data. The only difference is the comment ID
is appended to the end. So
`https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/krolrb/multicomments.json` becomes
`https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/krolrb/multicomments/{comment_id}.json`.
We can write a simple helper function to do this for us.

```
def create_thread_url(comment_id):
    return sanitized_thread_url.replace('.json', f'/{comment_id}.json')
```

We simply pass the `comment_id` as an argument and then do a string replace on
`.json` with `/{comment_id}.json`.

We're then ready to make the requests for the additional comments.

```
# handle extra comment ids
for id in more_comment_ids:
    req_data = requests.get(create_thread_url(
        id), headers={'User-agent': 'adamgoth.com'})
    if req_data.status_code != 200:
        print('request failed')
        print(req_data.json())

    if req_data.status_code == 200:
        json_data = req_data.json()
        for item in json_data:
            children = item['data']['children']
            parse_children_for_comments(children)
```

To fetch the additional comments, we'll use another `for` loop to loop through
each ID in the `more_comment_ids` array. For each one, we again use
`requests.get()`, passing the comment ID to the `create_thread_url` function we
just wrote, along with the same `User-agent` header as our previous request.
Once we have our response, we again check the status code, and if it's
successful, we'll parse the data the same way we did before, passing each child
in the data to `parse_children_for_comments`. As a word of caution, for posts
with thousands of comment replies, this can result in a large number of
additional comment IDs. It's possible to have hundreds of IDs to fetch. Each one
of these will require a synchronous network call, so it can take quite a while
if this is the case.

Once all the additional comment IDs have been fetched, we have all the data we
need to run our word analysis. To do this, we will combine all of the comments
in our global `comment_array` variable into a single string. We will then write
a function which will parse that string and keep track of how many times each
word appears. The function to do that looks like this:

```
def analyze_words(words):
    analysis_string = words.split(' ')
    word_dict = {}
    for word in analysis_string:
        cleaned_word = word.replace('.', '').replace("'", '').replace(
            '\n', '').replace(',', '').replace("’", '').lower()
        if cleaned_word not in word_dict:
            word_dict[cleaned_word] = 1
        else:
            word_dict[cleaned_word] += 1

    return word_dict
```

The function takes a single string as an argument called `words`. It then breaks
the string into an array of words called `analysis_string` by splitting the
string on each space character found in the string. We create an empty
[dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)
called `word_dict` that we will use to keep track of each word's appearance.
Then we loop through each word in our `analysis_string` array. For each word, we
use string replaces to strip out various common special characters (commas,
periods, etc.) and then call `.lower()` on it to convert all uppercase
characters to lowercase characters. This ensures that `The` and `the` are not
tracked as two different words. As we go through each word in the array, if the
word does not exist in our `word_dict` dictionary yet, we will add it and give
it a count value of `1`. If it already exists in `word_dict`, then we will just
increment the count value up by 1. When we are finished looping through each
word, we will return the `word_dict` we created.

The end of the script looks as follows:

```
comment_string = ' '.join(comment_array)
results = analyze_words(comment_string)

sorted = sorted(results.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

print(f'{comment_count} comments analyzed')

for key in sorted:
    print(key)
```

After combining all the comments into a single string and passing that string
through `analyze_words`, we can sort all the results by the number of
appearances counted by calling
`sorted = sorted(results.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)`. We can
then print the total number of comments we parsed and then each word and the
number of times it appeared.

### Wrapping up

The script in its entirety can be found
[here](https://github.com/adamgoth/reddit-comment-analysis/blob/master/reddit-comment-analysis.py).
To run the script, simply run `python reddit-comment-analysis.py` from the
directory containing the script file.

If you have Jupyter Notebooks installed, a more interactive version of this post
can be found
[here](https://github.com/adamgoth/reddit-comment-analysis/blob/master/word_analysis.ipynb).

This script serves as a basic starting point for fetching and analyzing data
from the web. There is room for many improvements and enhancements to this
script. Ideas for additional features include:

- Input validation
- Options for handling upper and lower casing
- Options for removing special characters
- Options for removing common words (the, and, I, etc.)

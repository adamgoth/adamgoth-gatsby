Enzyme has long been a popular library for testing React applications. More
recently, React Testing Library has been gaining traction in Enzyme's place. In
this post, we'll take a look at how the two compare.

### Overview

Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert,
manipulate, and traverse your React Componentsâ€™ output. It was created by AirBnB
and released in 2015. When using Enzyme, it is common to render the React
component that you are testing and then test the component based on certain
props or state that are passed, or by calling functions contained within the
component.

While Enzyme tests typically focus on components working correctly interally,
React Testing Library is more focused on testing the React application as it is
experienced by the user. Tests tend to be more focused on the state of the DOM
after imitating user behavior rather than the state of a particular component or
implementation.

In order to get a better understanding of this, let's look at some code.

### Setting up

In order to compare these two testing libraries, I've created two separate
repos. Both projects contain the same exact application (a to-do list, of
course). The only difference is that one test file is written using Enzyme and
the other is written using React Testing Library. You can easily follow along in
this post without running the application, but if you are interested, both repos
are available on GitHub.

[Repo for testing with Enzyme](https://github.com/adamgoth/testing-with-enzyme)

[Repo for testing with React Testing Library](https://github.com/adamgoth/testing-with-react-testing-library)

The file we're going to focus on in both repos is `src/components/ToDo.test.js`.

Below is our testing file written in the typical style of Enzyme.

```javascript
// testing-with-enzyme/src/components/ToDo.test.js

import React from "react"
import { mount } from "enzyme"
import ToDo from "./ToDo"

const setup = () => mount(<ToDo />)

describe("<ToDo/>", () => {
  describe("The default UI", () => {
    it("Renders two default todo items", () => {
      const app = setup()
      expect(app.find(".ToDoItem").length).toBe(2)
    })

    it("Has an input field", () => {
      const app = setup()
      expect(app.find(".ToDoInput").length).toEqual(1)
    })

    it("Has an add button", () => {
      const app = setup()
      expect(app.find(".ToDo-Add").length).toEqual(1)
    })
  })

  describe("Adding items", () => {
    window.alert = jest.fn()
    it("When the add button is pressed, if the input field is empty, prevent item from being added", () => {
      const app = setup()
      app.find(".ToDo-Add").simulate("click")
      expect(app.find(".ToDoItem").length).toBe(2)
    })

    it("When the add button is pressed, if the input field is empty, prevent item from being added", () => {
      const app = setup()
      app.find(".ToDo-Add").simulate("click")
      expect(window.alert).toHaveBeenCalled()
    })

    it("When the add button is pressed, if the input field has text, it creates a new todo item", () => {
      const app = setup()
      const event = { target: { value: "Create more tests" } }
      app.find("input").simulate("change", event)
      app.find(".ToDo-Add").simulate("click")
      expect(
        app
          .find(".ToDoItem-Text")
          .at(2)
          .text()
      ).toEqual("Create more tests")
    })
  })

  describe("Deleting items", () => {
    it("When the delete button is pressed for the first todo item, it removes the entire item", () => {
      const app = setup()
      app
        .find(".ToDoItem-Delete")
        .first()
        .simulate("click")
      expect(app.find(".ToDoItem").length).toBe(1)
    })
  })
})
```

And then, the same tests, written with React Testing Library.

```javascript
// testing-with-react-testing-library/src/components/ToDo.test.js

import React from "react"
import { render } from "@testing-library/react"
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event"
import ToDo from "./ToDo"

const setup = () => render(<ToDo />)

describe("<ToDo/>", () => {
  describe("The default UI", () => {
    it("Renders two default todo items", () => {
      const { getAllByRole } = setup()
      expect(getAllByRole("listitem").length).toBe(2)
    })

    it("Has an input field", () => {
      const { getByRole } = setup()
      expect(getByRole("textbox")).toBeInTheDocument()
    })

    it("Has an add button", () => {
      const { getByLabelText } = setup()
      expect(getByLabelText("add")).toBeInTheDocument()
    })
  })

  describe("Adding items", () => {
    it("When the add button is pressed, if the input field is empty, prevent item from being added", () => {
      const { getByLabelText } = setup()
      window.alert = jest.fn()
      userEvent.click(getByLabelText("add"))
      expect(window.alert).toHaveBeenCalled()
    })

    it("When the add button is pressed, if the input field has text, it creates a new todo item", async () => {
      const { getByRole, getByLabelText, getByText } = setup()
      const toDoItem = "fake item"
      userEvent.type(getByRole("textbox"), toDoItem)
      userEvent.click(getByLabelText("add"))
      const item = await getByText(toDoItem)
      expect(item).toBeInTheDocument()
    })
  })

  describe("Deleting items", () => {
    it("When the delete button is pressed for the first todo item, it removes the entire item", async () => {
      const { getAllByRole, getByLabelText, queryByText } = setup()
      // default item
      const toDoItem = "clean the house"
      userEvent.click(getByLabelText(`delete ${toDoItem}`))
      const item = await queryByText(toDoItem)
      expect(item).toBeNull()
      // should only be 1 item left
      expect(getAllByRole("listitem").length).toBe(1)
    })
  })
})
```

Both files test for the following:

- Renders two default todo items
- Has an input field
- Has an add button
- When the add button is pressed, if the input field is empty, prevent item from
  being added
- When the add button is pressed, if the input field has text, it creates a new
  todo item
- When the delete button is pressed for the first todo item, it removes the
  entire item

Because we are using Enzyme's `mount` function, the components in both tests are
rendered in a similar fashion, with an instance of the component being created
and then attached to the actual DOM. This would not be true if we had used
another popular Enzyme function, `shallow` to render our component. This post
does not focus on that difference, but you can read more about the difference
[here](https://gist.github.com/fokusferit/e4558d384e4e9cab95d04e5f35d4f913).

The first significant way in that the tests start to differ is when we go to
search for a particlar element in the DOM to assert its existance or its state.
Typically in an Enzyme test, you'll see elements searched for by their
classname, as follows:

```javascript
it("Renders two default todo items", () => {
  const app = setup()
  expect(app.find(".ToDoItem").length).toBe(2)
})
```

When writing the same test using React Testing Library, you'll notice that we
instead use a method called `getAllByRole`, and pass it an
[ARIA role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques)
of `listitem`.

```javascript
it("Renders two default todo items", () => {
  const { getAllByRole } = setup()
  expect(getAllByRole("listitem").length).toBe(2)
})
```

So why is one better than the other? While classnames are rather abitrary, ARIA
roles are not. ARIA roles provide additional context to elements for accessility
purposes. In the future, as developers, we may go and update our classname. We
may tweak the name, we may change the style, we may entirely change how we wrote
our CSS. If that happens, all of the sudden our test breaks. But the application
has not broken. By querying by an element's role rather than its classname, we
can ensure that we are testing the application by looking for elements in the
same manner that a user with assistive technology may be looking at the
application. We look for elements based on the purpose they convey to our users.

This concept is discussed in the React Testing Library docs,
[Which query should I use?](https://testing-library.com/docs/guide-which-query),
which provides recommendations for the order of priority in which you should
query for elements. For example, if we can't find an element by its role, our
next best bet is to look for a label. Why? Well, that's most likely what our
users would do to find a certain part of the application. This highlights
[React Testing Library's guiding principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles).

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more
> confidence they can give you.

The library is written to provide methods and utlities that encourage you to
tests that closely resemble how your web pages are used. It purposely drives the
user towards accessbility and away from testing implementation details.

Let's move on to another example and take a look at the difference in how we
test that our application successfully creates a new item in the to-do list.

With Enzyme, it's common to manually create DOM events and then pass them to
Enzyme's `simulate` function, telling it to simulate the `change` event with
this event data that we've created. Below is an example of this.

```javascript
// testing-with-enzyme/src/components/ToDo.test.js

it("When the add button is pressed, if the input field has text, it creates a new todo item", () => {
  const app = setup()
  const event = { target: { value: "Create more tests" } }
  app.find("input").simulate("change", event)
  app.find(".ToDo-Add").simulate("click")
  expect(
    app
      .find(".ToDoItem-Text")
      .at(2)
      .text()
  ).toEqual("Create more tests")
})
```

While this does what we'd expect to, it doesn't test the application in the same
manner the user would use it. There is a lot of API and implementation
information we need to know in order for the test to work. We need to know what
the event should look like. We need to know which event API to simulate. We need
to know the classname of the element we want to click. We need to know the
classname of the new list item to look for is. And lastly, we need to know what
order the element should be in so we can compare the text. None of these things
are things the user actually knows or cares about. All they know is that when
they type in the box and then click the add button, a new item is added to the
list.

In order to get away from testing our code implementation and get closer to
testing how the application is actually used, we turn once again to React
Testing Library. Instead of creating fake DOM event objects and simulating
various change events, we have the ability to mimic how users would actually
interact with the application using `userEvent`'s, which are provided by the
[user-event](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event) library.

> user-event tries to simulate the real events that would happen in the browser
> as the user interacts with it. For example userEvent.click(checkbox) would
> change the state of the checkbox.

Using this, the same test written in React Testing Library looks as follows:

```javascript
// testing-with-react-testing-library/src/components/ToDo.test.js

it("When the add button is pressed, if the input field has text, it creates a new todo item", async () => {
  const { getByRole, getByLabelText, getByText } = setup()
  const toDoItem = "fake item"
  userEvent.type(getByRole("textbox"), toDoItem)
  userEvent.click(getByLabelText("add"))
  const item = await getByText(toDoItem)
  expect(item).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

In contrast to the Enzyme test, to write the React Testing Library test, we
don't need to know much more than what the user would now. We first look for an
element with the role of `textbox`, we then simulate the user typing by using
`userEvent.type`, we simuluate the user clicking with `userEvent.click` on the
element with the accessbility label of `add`. We then assert that the text we
typed in is appearing in the document.

In addition to being a much closer representation of the user's experience with
the application, writing this test this way also makes for a much less brittle
test. We could update classnames or change the number of items in the list and
the test would still pass, because the application would still be working. The
same can not be said for the first test written in Enzyme.

### Wrapping up

These examples are shown to attempt to highlight some of the benefits that React
Testing Library offers and how it differs from the more traditional testing
library of Enzyme. Everything React Testing Library offers always comes back to
its guiding principle.

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more
> confidence they can give you.

We've all been there before when a little tiny change to a component causes a
test to break without actually breaking any functionality. React Testing
Library, used properly, guides us away from writing these types of implentation
tests and towards writing robust tests and more accessbile code.

This post is intended as a high-level introduction to the library. It only
scratches the surface of all the library has to offer. To learn more, check out

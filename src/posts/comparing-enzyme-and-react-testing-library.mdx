Enzyme has long been a popular library for testing React applications. More
recently, React Testing Library has been gaining popularity in Enzyme's place.
In this post, we'll take a look at how the two compare.

### Overview

Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert,
manipulate, and traverse your React Componentsâ€™ output. It was created by AirBnB
and released in 2015. When using Enzyme, it is common to mount the React
component that you are testing and then test the component based on certain
props or state that are passed, or by calling functions contained within the
component.

While Enzyme tests typically focus on components working correctly interally,
React Testing Library is more focused on testing the React application as it is
experienced by the user. Tests tend to be more focused on the state of the DOM
after imitating user behavior rather than the state of a particular component or
implementation.

In order to get a better understanding of this, let's look at some code.

### Setting up

In order to compare these two testing libraries, I've created two separate
repos. Both projects contain the same exact application (a to-do list, of
course). The only difference is in the testing. Both repos are available on
GitHub.

[Repo for testing with Enzyme](https://github.com/adamgoth/testing-with-enzyme)

[Repo for testing with React Testing Library](https://github.com/adamgoth/testing-with-react-testing-library)

The file we're going to focus on in both repos is `src/components/ToDo.test.js`.

Below is the test for our application, written in the typical style of Enzyme.

```javascript
// testing-with-enzyme/src/components/ToDo.test.js

import React from "react"
import { mount } from "enzyme"
import ToDo from "./ToDo"

describe("<ToDo/>", () => {
  const app = mount(<ToDo />)

  it("Renders without crashing", () => {
    expect(app.length).toEqual(1)
  })

  describe("The default UI", () => {
    it("Renders two default todo items", () => {
      expect(app.find(".ToDoItem").length).toBe(2)
    })

    it("Has an input field", () => {
      expect(app.find(".ToDoInput").length).toEqual(1)
    })

    it("Has an add button", () => {
      expect(app.find(".ToDo-Add").length).toEqual(1)
    })
  })

  describe("Adding items", () => {
    afterAll(() => {
      app.find(".ToDoItem-Delete").simulate("click")
    })

    window.alert = jest.fn()
    it("When the add button is pressed, if the input field is empty, prevent item from being added", () => {
      app.find(".ToDo-Add").simulate("click")
      expect(app.find(".ToDoItem").length).toBe(2)
    })

    it("When the add button is pressed, if the input field is empty, prevent item from being added", () => {
      app.find(".ToDo-Add").simulate("click")
      expect(window.alert).toHaveBeenCalled()
    })

    it("When the add button is pressed, if the input field has text, it creates a new todo item", () => {
      const event = { target: { value: "Create more tests" } }
      app.find("input").simulate("change", event)
      app.find(".ToDo-Add").simulate("click")

      expect(
        app
          .find(".ToDoItem-Text")
          .at(2)
          .text()
      ).toEqual("Create more tests")
    })
  })

  describe("Deleting items", () => {
    it("When the delete button is pressed for the first todo item, it removes the entire item", () => {
      app
        .find(".ToDoItem-Delete")
        .first()
        .simulate("click")

      expect(app.find(".ToDoItem").length).toBe(2)
    })
    it("means that because the first toDoItem was deleted, the first toDoItem should now be buy milk", () => {
      expect(
        app
          .find(".ToDoItem-Text")
          .first()
          .text()
      ).toEqual("buy milk")
    })
  })
})
```

And then, the same tests, written with React Testing Library.

```javascript
// testing-with-react-testing-library/src/components/ToDo.test.js

import React from "react"
import { mount } from "enzyme"
import ToDo from "./ToDo"

describe("<ToDo/>", () => {
  const app = mount(<ToDo />)

  it("Renders without crashing", () => {
    expect(app.length).toEqual(1)
  })

  describe("The default UI", () => {
    it("Renders two default todo items", () => {
      expect(app.find(".ToDoItem").length).toBe(2)
    })

    it("Has an input field", () => {
      expect(app.find(".ToDoInput").length).toEqual(1)
    })

    it("Has an add button", () => {
      expect(app.find(".ToDo-Add").length).toEqual(1)
    })
  })

  describe("Adding items", () => {
    afterAll(() => {
      app.find(".ToDoItem-Delete").simulate("click")
    })

    window.alert = jest.fn()
    it("When the add button is pressed, if the input field is empty, prevent item from being added", () => {
      app.find(".ToDo-Add").simulate("click")
      expect(app.find(".ToDoItem").length).toBe(2)
    })

    it("When the add button is pressed, if the input field is empty, prevent item from being added", () => {
      app.find(".ToDo-Add").simulate("click")
      expect(window.alert).toHaveBeenCalled()
    })

    it("When the add button is pressed, if the input field has text, it creates a new todo item", () => {
      const event = { target: { value: "Create more tests" } }
      app.find("input").simulate("change", event)
      app.find(".ToDo-Add").simulate("click")

      expect(
        app
          .find(".ToDoItem-Text")
          .at(2)
          .text()
      ).toEqual("Create more tests")
    })
  })

  describe("Deleting items", () => {
    it("When the delete button is pressed for the first todo item, it removes the entire item", () => {
      app
        .find(".ToDoItem-Delete")
        .first()
        .simulate("click")

      expect(app.find(".ToDoItem").length).toBe(2)
    })
    it("means that because the first toDoItem was deleted, the first toDoItem should now be buy milk", () => {
      expect(
        app
          .find(".ToDoItem-Text")
          .first()
          .text()
      ).toEqual("buy milk")
    })
  })
})
```

I recently spent some time diving into all that Chrome's developer tools have to
offer. It's quite impressive what the Chrome team has built to make the lives of
web developers easier. In this post, I will share a handful of the nifty things
I learned.

Let's jump in.

### Toggle the console drawer

Most people are probably familiar with the
[Console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/reference)
tab. But you can open a console drawer from almost any other tab as well. This
can easily be toggled by simply hitting the `esc` key.

### Toggle all nested elements

Clicking an element within the Elements tab will expand that particular element
and show you any children elements belonging to it. Sometimes, elements can be
nested several layers deep. By holding the `option` key while clicking an
element, you can expand **all** children nested within that element.

### Scroll element into view

Sometimes you may see an element with your Elements tab and wonder where exactly
that element lives on the page. Usually, you can see the element get highlighted
on the page as you hover it in the Elements tab, but sometimes the element is
not within the page view. If you right-click the element, you can choose the
"Scroll into view" option and Chrome will do just that.

### Toggle an element's visibility

For whatever reason, you may want to toggle whether an element on your page can
be seen or not. This can easily be done by simply hitting the `h` key while the
element is selected in the Elements tab.

### Converting color formats

When viewing an element's CSS `color` property in dev tools, you can toggle
between RGB, HSL, and hex color formats by holding the `shift` key and clicking
the color square. This can be convenient in various situations where you may
find a color in one format, but need it in another.

### Access recently selected elements in console

Sometimes we need access to DOM elements in the console so that we can inspect
various properties or behavior. Chrome provides a quick shortcut to access these
elements within the console. If you type `$0` into the console, you will get the
element you most recently interacted with in the Elements tab. If you type in
`$1`, you will get the second most recent element you interacted with, and so
forth...

### Run commands

By pressing `command` + `shift` + `p`, you can search dev tools for nearly
anything and quickly
[run various commands](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/command-menu).
This gives you extremely quick access to many features of the dev tools. Give
this one a try, you may find something you didn't know existed.

### Blackbox scripts

Ever get stuck debugging in some random runtime file that you never wanted to be
in?
[Blackboxing scripts](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/blackboxing) is
your new friend. If there is a script that you do not want your debugger to go
into, you can right-click it and select "Blackbox script". Easy enough.

### Conditional breakpoints

If you have used the debugger in the dev tools before, you are likely aware that
you can set breakpoints to pause your code execution. In addition to your
standard breakpoint, Chrome allows you to also set
[conditional breakpoints](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/breakpoints).
This allows you to specify that a variable must have a certain value in order
for the breakpoint to hit. This can be very convenient when you are trying to
debug an issue where a particular value must be present. To set a conditional
breakpoint, right-click the line you want to set it at and click "Add
conditional breakpoint..."

### Networking calls: Who called what?

Sometimes we see network calls in the
[Network](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network/reference)
tab and we're not sure where they came from. Chrome has a neat trick that shows
you if one network call was initiated by another call and if that network call
in turn has dependencies of its own. To take a look, simply hold `shift` while
hovering a network call. Initiators are colored green and dependencies are
colored red.

### Select multiple networking request types

If you are familiar with the Network tab, you are likely aware that you can
select a certain type of network request to filter your results, e.g. XHR. But
maybe you are interested in both XHR and JS requests. By holding `command` and
clicking different request types, you can select multiple types of requests at
once.

### Wrapping up

The Chrome Dev Tools are seriously impressive. These tips are just the tip of
the iceberg. The deeper you dive into what features are available to you, the
more amazed you will be. The
[documentation](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) is a
great reference. If you are more of a visual learner, I would recommend the

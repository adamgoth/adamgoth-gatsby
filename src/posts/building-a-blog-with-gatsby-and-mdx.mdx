### Overview

I've long considered trying out blogging. Now, I'm finally giving it a go.

This first post is all about how I built this blog feature into my site using
Gatsby and MDX. For background context, I built this site about two years ago
using Gatsby. Given that it is essentially a single landing page with various
social links, using Gatsby wasn't entirely necessary. But I had been looking for
an excuse to try it out. Fast forward two years, I've decided to make further
use of Gatsby and leverage it to add a blog to the site.

The basic idea behind this project is to use Gatsby plugins and APIs to
dynamically generate blog pages from MDX files within our project. The plugins
we'll use include the
[gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/)
plugin and
[gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/) along
with the [createPages](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/#createPages)
Gatsby Node API. After setting those up, we'll then take a brief look at how to
template our posts and style our MDX elements. So how does all this work? Let's
jump in.

_Note: This blog post assumes basic Gatsby and React knowledge. If you are
unfamiliar with Gatsby, there is a
[great tutorial series](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/) available on
Gatsby's site to get you up to speed. Additionally, I will not be setting the
project up step by step, but will provide enough information that you could
easily integrate a similar blog feature into any existing Gatsby project._

### Setting up

Our first requirement is the
[gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/)
plugin. What this plugin allows us to do is to use our project's filesystem as a
source for data in our application. This is how we are eventually going to be
able to query our project for MDX files and convert them into blog page content.

Our second requirement is going to be the
[gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/) plugin.
This is the official integration for using MDX within Gatsby. If you are
unfamiliar with MDX, it is essentially a file format that allows you to combine
standard [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) with
[JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). I won't go into much
detail but it is pretty neat, especially if you are a React developer and are
used to writing JSX. You can read more about [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) here.

After
[installing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/#installation)
both plugins, we can configure them in our `gatsby-config.js` file as follows.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ...,
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `posts`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src/posts/`,
      },
    },
    `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
  ],
}
```

The `path` value here is `src/posts/` which is where I will store my MDX files.
This configuration tells Gatsby to query this particular directory for data.

Now that we have our plugins configured, our project is ready to query for MDX
files and turn them into blog pages. But just how do we tell it to do that?

The answer is Gatsby's
[createPages](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/#createPages) API. If you
are familiar with Gatsby, you know that by default, Gatsby core creates pages
for any React files that it finds in the `src/pages/` directory. In a similar
fashion, this API allows us to instruct Gatsby to create additional pages based
on the criteria we specify. When all is said and done, our `gatsby-node.js` file
(located in the project's root directory) will look as follows:

```javascript
const path = require("path")

exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions, reporter }) => {
  // destructure the createPage function from the actions object
  const { createPage } = actions

  const result = await graphql(`
    query {
      allMdx {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            frontmatter {
              slug
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  if (result.errors) {
    reporter.panicOnBuild('ðŸš¨  ERROR: Loading "createPages" query')
  }

  // create blog post pages
  const posts = result.data.allMdx.edges

  // call `createPage` for each result
  posts.forEach(({ node }, index) => {
    createPage({
      path: node.frontmatter.slug,
      component: path.resolve(`./src/components/posts-page-layout.js`),
      // you can use the values in this context in
      // our page layout component
      context: { id: node.id },
    })
  })
}
```

In the code above, we first query our filesystem for MDX files starting on
line 7. These will be located in the directory we specified in our earlier
configuration. Each node in our query results is an MDX file that was found.

Then starting on line 30, for each MDX file (or "post"), we call `createPage`,
passing it a `path` value which will serve as our post's URL, a `component`
value which will be used as our page template, and a `context` object which can
hold additional data to be made available to us within our template component.

You may have noticed that on line 13, within each file result, we expect
something called `frontmatter`.
[Frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-markdown-pages/#frontmatter-for-metadata-in-markdown-files)
is a set of key-value pairs that can be used to provide additional data about
the file. In our case, we're going to use frontmatter for storing information
about the blog, including details such as our posts title, slug, date, author,
and more. Frontmatter is denoted in a Markdown file by three dashes at the start
and end of a block.

### Creating posts from MDX files

Now that the project is configured to dynmically create pages from MDX files, we
need to create our MDX file within the directory we specified our
`gatsby-source-filesystem` configuration (`src/posts/`). If you are using a
`slug` frontmatter key-value pair for your `path` value as we are, the name of
the file is not so important, as long as it is an MDX file. For consistency, I
will give it the same name as the slug
(`src/posts/building-a-blog-with-gatsby-and-mdx.mdx`). Make special note of the
frontmatter at the top of the file, located between the `---` lines. The `slug`
value is what will make your post available at `http://<yourdomain>/<slug>`. We
will make use of the rest of the frontmatter data in our page template.

```markdown
---
title: Building a blog with Gatsby and MDX
slug: building-a-blog-with-gatsby-and-mdx
author: Adam Goth
---

Blog content here...
```

The last missing piece that our `createPages` function expects is the template
component that we specified as the `component` value in our `createPage` call.
The value we passed is `./src/components/posts-page-layout.js`, so let's go
ahead and create that file.

```jsx
import React from "react"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"
import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react"
import { MDXRenderer } from "gatsby-plugin-mdx"
import Layout from "../components/layout"
import components from "./mdxComponents"

export default function PageTemplate({ data: { mdx } }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <div style={{ padding: "0 1rem", marginBottom: "10rem" }}>
        <h1>{mdx.frontmatter.title}</h1>
        <h4
          style={{
            color: "gray",
            fontWeight: "normal",
          }}
        >{`${mdx.frontmatter.date} by ${mdx.frontmatter.author}`}</h4>
        <MDXProvider components={components}>
          <MDXRenderer>{mdx.body}</MDXRenderer>
        </MDXProvider>
      </div>
    </Layout>
  )
}

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query BlogPostQuery($id: String) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
      id
      body
      frontmatter {
        title
        date
        author
      }
    }
  }
`
```

There are a few things to make note of here. If you are familiar with Gatsby and
React, nothing should look too out of the ordinary here. Starting on line 27, we
are using a graphQL query called `BlogPostQuery` to query our filesystem for an
MDX file with the matching `id`. The `id` is generated in our `createPages`
function and is passed via the `context` parameter to our page template
component. From the results, we get our `body` and `frontmatter` data for the
blog post from our MDX file. We can then access the query data in our component
via our component's props (see line 8 above).

### Styling MDX content

If we wanted to render the body and frontmatter data as plain HTML elements
within our JSX, we could go ahead and do that within our `PageTemplate`
component above. In fact, that is how the title is being rendered on line 12.
But `@mdx-js/react` and `gatsby-plugin-mdx` provide us with `<MDXProvider />`
and `<MDXRenderer />` components. These components allow us customize the style
of our MDX content. Let's take a look at how.

In the above code block, we're importing `components` from `'./mdxComponents'`
and passing it to `<MDXProvider />`. This `components` prop on `<MDXProvider />`
allows us to pass customized components for each type of Markdown element we may
expect to render.

For example, in Markdown and MDX, a standard line of text gets rendered as a
paragraph (`<p>`) element. But for my posts, I want my paragraph elements to
contain a certain line height different from the default. I also want to provide
my own margin and width properties. The way this can be accompished is by
creating a custom `paragraph` MDX component and passing it in to the
`components` prop to `MDXProvider />`.

In my `src/components/mdxComponents` directory, I have a `paragraph.js` file
that looks as follows:

```javascript
import React from "react"

export default ({ children }) => (
  <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.7", maxWidth: "750px", margin: "30px auto" }}>
    {children}
  </p>
)
```

In the same `src/components/mdxComponents` directory, I also have an `index.js`
file which exports the component from `paragraph.js` as well as all the other
elements I have created customized MDX components for. I then import that as an
object named `components` and pass it to `<MDXProvider />`. The `body` of our
MDX file data is then passed as the `children` prop to `<MDXRenderer />` on line
20, which then makes use of these components when it renders the MDX content. In
addition to the paragraph element, a full list of other elements that can be
customized in MDX can be found
[here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/mdx/customizing-components/).

### Wrapping up

That concludes the process for how I've built out a blog feature, as well as the
very blog post you are reading. Using Gatsby plugins `gatsby-source-filesystem`
and `gatsby-plugin-mdx`, along with Gatsby's `createPages` API, we are able to
use MDX files to dynamically generate pages for blog posts. Going forward, for
my next post, all I will need to do is write the new MDX file and add it to
`src/posts/`. I eventually plan on adding additional features such as tags,
categories, search, and who knows what else. So if you are interested in that as
well, stay tuned!

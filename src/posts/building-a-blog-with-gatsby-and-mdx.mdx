I've long considered trying out blogging. I'm finally giving it a go.

My first post is going to be about how I built this very blog using Gatsby and
MDX. For background context, I built my personal site that you are currently on
about two years ago using Gatsby. Given that it is essentially a single landing
page with links, using Gatsby wasn't entirely necessary, but I had been looking
for an excuse to try it out. Fast forward two years, I've decided to make
further use of Gatsby by adding on a blog to the site.

The basic idea is to use the
[gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/)
plugin and
[gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/) along
with the [createPages](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/#createPages)
Gatsby Node API to dynamically generate blog pages from MDX files in our
project. Just how does this work? Let's jump in.

_Note: This blog post will assume basic Gatsby knowledge. If you are unfamiliar,
there is a [great tutorial series](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/) available
on Gatsby's site to get you up to speed. Additionally, I will not be setting the
project up step by step, but will provide enough information that you could
integrate a similar blog into any existing Gatsby project._

### Setting up

Our first requirement is the
[gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem/)
plugin. What this plugin allows us to do is to use our projects filesystem as a
source for data to use in our application. This is how we are eventually going
to be able to query our project for MDX files and convert them into blog page
content.

Our second requirement is going to be the
[gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/) plugin.
This is the official integration for using MDX within Gatsby. If you are
unfamiliar with MDX, it is essentially a file format that allows you to combine
standard [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) with
[JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). I won't go into much
detail but it is pretty neat, especially if you are a React developer and are
used to writing JSX. You can read more about [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) here.

After installing both plugins, we can configure them in our `gatsby-config.js`
file as follows.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ...,
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `posts`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src/posts/`,
      },
    },
    `gatsby-plugin-mdx`,
  ],
}
```

The `path` value here is `src/posts/` which is where I will store my MDX files.
This configuration will tell Gatsby to query this particular directory for data.

Now that we have our plugins configured, our project is ready to query for MDX
files and turn them into blog pages. But just how do we tell it to do that?

The answer is Gatsby's
[createPages](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/#createPages) API. If you
are familiar with Gatsby, you know that by default, Gatsby core creates pages
for any React files that it finds in the `src/pages/` directory. In a similar
fashion, this API allows us to instruct Gatsby to create additional pages based
on the criteria we specify. When all is said and done, our `gatsby-node.js` file
(located in the project's root directory) will look as follows:

```javascript
const path = require("path")

exports.createPages = async ({ graphql, actions, reporter }) => {
  // destructure the createPage function from the actions object
  const { createPage } = actions

  const result = await graphql(`
    query {
      allMdx {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            frontmatter {
              slug
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `)

  if (result.errors) {
    reporter.panicOnBuild('ðŸš¨  ERROR: Loading "createPages" query')
  }

  // create blog post pages
  const posts = result.data.allMdx.edges

  // call `createPage` for each result
  posts.forEach(({ node }, index) => {
    createPage({
      path: node.frontmatter.slug,
      component: path.resolve(`./src/components/posts-page-layout.js`),
      // you can use the values in this context in
      // our page layout component
      context: { id: node.id },
    })
  })
}
```

We first query our filesystem for MDX files. These will be located in the
directory we specified in our earlier configuration. Each node in our query
results is an MDX file that was found.

For each file, we then call `createPages` passing it a `path` value which will
serve as our URL, a `component` value which will be used as our page layout, and
a `context` object which can hold additional data to be made available to us
within our layout component.

Within each file result, we have something called `frontmatter`.
[Frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-markdown-pages/#frontmatter-for-metadata-in-markdown-files)
is a set of key value pairs that can be used to provide additional data about
the file. In our case, we're going to use frontmatter for storing information
about the blog, including details such as our posts title, slug, date, author,
and more. Frontmatter is denoted in a Markdown file by three dashes at the start
and end of a block.

### Creating posts from MDX files

Now that the project is configured to dynmically create pages from MDX files, we
need to create our MDX file within the directory we specified our
`gatsby-source-filesystem` to look for posts in (`src/posts/`). If you are using
a `slug` frontmatter key value pair for your `path` value as we are, the name of
the file is not so important, as long as it is an MDX file. For consistency, I
will give it the same name as the slug
(`src/posts/building-a-blog-with-gatsby-and-mdx.mdx`). Make special note of the
frontmatter at the top of the file. We will make use of this data in our page
template.

```markdown
---

Blog content here...
```

The last missing piece that our `createPages` function expects is the template
component that we specified as the `component` value in our `createPage` call.
The value we passed is `./src/components/posts-page-layout.js`, so let's go
ahead and create that file.

```jsx
import React from "react"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"
import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react"
import { MDXRenderer } from "gatsby-plugin-mdx"
import Layout from "../components/layout"
import components from "./mdxComponents"

import "./posts-page-layout.scss"

export default function PageTemplate({ data: { mdx } }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <h1>{mdx.frontmatter.title}</h1>
      <h4 className="template__post-info">{`${mdx.frontmatter.date} by ${mdx.frontmatter.author}`}</h4>
      <MDXProvider components={components}>
        <MDXRenderer>{mdx.body}</MDXRenderer>
      </MDXProvider>
    </Layout>
  )
}

export const pageQuery = graphql`
  query BlogPostQuery($id: String) {
    mdx(id: { eq: $id }) {
      id
      body
      frontmatter {
        title
        date
        author
      }
    }
  }
`
```

There are a few things to make note of here. If you are familiar with Gatsby and
React, nothing should look too out of the ordinary here. We are first using a
graphQL query to query our filesystem for an MDX file with the matching `id`.
The `id` is generated in our `createPages` function and is passed via context to
our page template component. From the results, we get our `body` and
`frontmatter` data.

If we wanted to render this as plain HTML/JSX, we could go ahead and do that.
But `@mdx-js/react` and `gatsby-plugin-mdx` provide us with `<MDXProvider />`
and `<MDXRenderer />` components.
